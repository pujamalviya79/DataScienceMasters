    "Intuition determines which option to choose when two alternatives are apparently equal, it speeds up the decision-making process and, when hard facts are insufficient, it allows the individual to decide on one path or another.\n",
    "In a decision tree, for predicting the class of the given dataset, the algorithm starts from the root node of the tree. \n",
    "This algorithm compares the values of root attribute with the record (real dataset) attribute and, based on the comparison, follows the branch and jumps to the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next node, the algorithm again compares the attribute value with the other sub-nodes and move further. \n",
    "It continues the process until it reaches the leaf node of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step-1: Begin the tree with the root node, says S, which contains the complete dataset.\n",
    "Step-2: Find the best attribute in the dataset using Attribute Selection Measure (ASM).\n",
    "Step-3: Divide the S into subsets that contains possible values for the best attributes.\n",
    "Step-4: Generate the decision tree node, which contains the best attribute.\n",
    "Step-5: Recursively make new decision trees using the subsets of the dataset created in step -3. \n",
    "    Continue this process until a stage is reached where you cannot further classify the nodes and called the final node as a leaf node."
