    "    Z-test implies a hypothesis test which ascertains if the means of two datasets are different from each other when variance is given.\n",

    "        Solution: As the sample size is 81 and population standard deviation is known, this is an example of a right-tailed one-sample z test.\n",

    "        As 3.6 > 1.645 thus, the null hypothesis is rejected and it is concluded that there is enough evidence to support the teacher's claim.\n",

    "        Also, comment on whether the sample statistics are significantly different from the population at a 99.5% confidence interval.\n",
    "        Solution:\n",
    "            t = ( x̄ – μ) / (s / √n)\n",
    "            t = (74 – 78) / (3.5 / √10)\n",
    "            t = -3.61\n",
    "            Therefore, the sample’s absolute t-test value is 3.61, which is less than the critical value (3.69) at a 99.5% confidence interval with a degree of freedom of 9. \n",
    "            So, the hypothesis of the sample statistic is different than the population and can be rejected."
