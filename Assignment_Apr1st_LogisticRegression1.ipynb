    "Q5. What are some common techniques for feature selection in logistic regression? How do these\n",
    "techniques help improve the model's performance?\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "Types of Feature Selection Methods in ML:\n",
    "    Chi-square Test\n",
    "        The Chi-square test is used for categorical features in a dataset. \n",
    "        We calculate Chi-square between each feature and the target and select the desired number of features with the best Chi-square scores. \n",
    "    Fisher’s Score\n",
    "        Fisher score is one of the most widely used supervised feature selection methods. \n",
    "        The algorithm we will use returns the ranks of the variables based on the fisher’s score in descending order. \n",
    "    Correlation Coefficient\n",
    "        Correlation is a measure of the linear relationship between 2 or more variables. \n",
    "        Through correlation, we can predict one variable from the other. \n",
    "    Variance Threshold\n",
    "        The variance threshold is a simple baseline approach to feature selection. \n",
    "        It removes all features whose variance doesn’t meet some threshold. \n",
    "        By default, it removes all zero-variance features, i.e., features with the same value in all samples.\n",
    "    Forward Feature Selection\n",
    "        This is an iterative method wherein we start with the performing features against the target features. \n",
    "    Backward Feature Elimination\n",
    "        This method works exactly opposite to the Forward Feature Selection method. \n",
    "        Here, we start with all the features available and build a model. \n",
    "        Next, we the variable from the model, which gives the best evaluation measure value.\n",
    "    Exhaustive Feature Selection\n",
    "        This is the most robust feature selection method covered so far. \n",
    "        This is a brute-force evaluation of each feature subset. \n",
    "        This means it tries every possible combination of the variables and returns the best-performing subset.\n",
    "    Recursive Feature Elimination\n",
    "        Given an external estimator that assigns weights to features (e.g., the coefficients of a linear model), the goal of recursive feature elimination (RFE) is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features. \n",
    "    LASSO Regularization (L1)\n",
    "        Regularization consists of adding a penalty to the different parameters of the machine learning model to reduce the freedom of the model, i.e., to avoid over-fitting.\n",
    "    Random Forest Importance\n",
    "        Random Forests is a kind of Bagging Algorithm that aggregates a specified number of decision trees. \n",
    "        The tree-based strategies used by random forests naturally rank by how well they improve the purity of the node, or in other words, a decrease in the impurity (Gini impurity) over all trees."
