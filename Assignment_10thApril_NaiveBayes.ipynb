    "    Bernoulli Naive Bayes assumes that the features are binary variables.\n",
    "    It is typically used when dealing with binary or Boolean features.\n",
    "    In Bernoulli Naive Bayes, each feature is treated as a binary variable, where 1 represents the presence of the feature and 0 represents the absence.\n",

    "Q3. How does Bernoulli Naive Bayes handle missing values?\n",
    "--------------------------------------------\n",

    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes typically handles missing values by either ignoring instances with missing values or by imputing the missing values with a specific value.\n",
    "1.Ignoring instances with missing values:\n",
    "    In this approach, instances with missing values are simply excluded from the analysis.\n",
    "    While this approach is straightforward, it can lead to loss of valuable data, especially if a significant portion of the dataset contains missing values.\n",
    "2.Imputing missing values:\n",
    "    Instead of ignoring instances with missing values, another approach is to impute (fill in) the missing values with some predetermined value.\n",
    "    For Bernoulli Naive Bayes, where features are binary, missing values can be imputed with either 0 or 1, depending on which value is more appropriate for the context."
