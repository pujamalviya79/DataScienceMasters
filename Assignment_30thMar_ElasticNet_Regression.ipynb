    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "Elastic net linear regression uses the penalties from both the lasso and ridge techniques to regularize regression models. \n",

    "----------\n",

    "Smaller values imply weak regularization (overfitting). \n",
    "We want to build a model that neither overfits nor underfit the data. So, we need to choose an optimal value for alpha.\n",

    "Q3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "----------\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "    1. Feature Selection: Like Lasso, ElasticNet performs feature selection, making it easier to interpret the model.\n",
    "    2. Handling Multicollinearity: ElasticNet can handle multicollinearity between variables by grouping them, which can be very useful in certain datasets.\n",
    "    3. Bias-Variance Trade-off: ElasticNet manages the bias-variance trade-off by balancing between Ridge and Lasso regression.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "    1. Computationally Intensive: ElasticNet can be computationally expensive on large datasets due to the need to tune the model.\n",
    "    2. Selection of Parameters: The selection of tuning parameters (alpha and lambda) can be tricky, as there is no definitive way to choose these parameters."

    "Elastic net can also be used in other applications, such as in sparse PCA, where it obtains principal components that are modified by sparse loadings. \n",
    "The other application is in the kernel elastic net, where the generation of class kernel machines takes place with support vectors."

    "The L1 norm is used to perform feature selection, whereas the L2 norm is used to perform feature shrinkage.\n",
