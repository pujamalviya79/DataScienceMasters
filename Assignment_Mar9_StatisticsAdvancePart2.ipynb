    "Probability mass function is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. \n",
    "Sometimes it is also known as the discrete density function.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    Suppose a fair coin is tossed twice and the sample space is recorded as S = [HH, HT, TH, TT]. \n",
    "    The probability of getting heads needs to be determined. Let X be the random variable that shows how many heads are obtained. \n",
    "    X can take on the values 0, 1, 2. The probability that X will be equal to 1 is 0.5. \n",
    "    Thus, it can be said that the probability mass function of X evaluated at 1 will be 0.5.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Probability density function, or density of a continuous random variable, \n",
    "is a function whose value at any given sample in the sample space can be interpreted as providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would be equal to that sample.\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "    Suppose we have a continuous random variable whose probability density function is given by f(x) = x + 2, when 0 < x ≤ 2. We want to find P(0.5 < X < 1). \n",
    "    Then we integrate x + 2 within the limits 0.5 and 1. This gives us 1.375. \n",
    "    Thus, the probability that the continuous random variable lies between 0.5 and 1 is 1.375."
