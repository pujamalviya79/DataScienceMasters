    "Q1. Explain the assumptions required to use ANOVA and provide examples of violations that could impact\n",
    "the validity of the results.\n",
    "----------\n",
    "ANOVA assumptions are:\n",
    "1. An ANOVA can only be conducted if there is no relationship between the subjects in each sample. \n",
    "    This means that subjects in the first group cannot also be in the second group.\n",
    "2. The different groups/levels must have equal sample sizes.\n",
    "3. An ANOVA can only be conducted if the dependent variable is normally distributed so that the middle scores are the most frequent and the extreme scores are the least frequent.\n",
    "4. Population variances must be equal. \n",
    "    Homogeneity of variance means that the deviation of scores is similar between populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples where it can impact validaity of the results:\n",
    "Fixed Effect - Example, in a cake recipe experiment, the researcher sets the three oven temperatures of 350, 400, and 450 degrees for the study. \n",
    "    Oven temperature is a fixed factor.\n",
    "Random Effects - Example, in studies involving human subjects, Subject is typically a random factor because researchers sample participants from a population.\n",
    "Mixed-effects - Example, a store chain wants to assess sales. \n",
    "    The chain chooses five states for its study. \n",
    "    State is a fixed factor. \n",
    "    Within these states, the chain randomly selects stores. \n",
    "    Store is a random factor. \n",
    "    It is also nested within the State factor."

    "    A Bonferroni test is a series of  t-tests performed on each pair of groups. \n",
    "    As the number of groups quickly grows the number of comparisons, which inflates Type I error rates. \n",
    "    To avoid this, a Bonferroni test divides our significance level  α by the number of comparisons we are making so that when they are all run, they sum back up to our original Type I error rate. \n",

    "    \n",
    "2.Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference : Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD) is a very popular post hoc analysis. \n",
    "    This analysis, like Bonferroni’s, makes adjustments based on the number of comparisons, but it makes adjustments to the test statistic when running the comparisons of two groups. \n",
    "    These comparisons give us an estimate of the difference between the groups and a confidence interval for the estimate. \n",
    "    We use this confidence interval in the same way that we use a confidence interval for a regular independent samples  t-test:\n",
    "        if it contains 0.00, the groups are not different, but if it does not contain 0.00 then the groups are different.\n",

    "3.Scheffe’s Test : Scheffe’s test adjusts the test statistic for how many comparisons are made, but it does so in a slightly different way. \n",
    "    The result is a test that is \"conservative,\" which means that it is less likely to commit a Type I Error, but this comes at the cost of less power to detect effects."
