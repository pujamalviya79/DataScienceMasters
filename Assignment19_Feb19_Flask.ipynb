    "-----\n",
    "Flask is a web framework, it’s a Python module that lets you develop web applications easily.\n",

    "\n",
    "Advantages of flask:\n",
    "- Scalable : Flask’s status is microframework means that you can use it to grow a tech project such as a web app incredibly quickly.\n",
    "- Flexible : It can be easily rearranged and moved around.\n",
    "- Easy to negotiate : The microframework is easy to understand for web developers,not just saving them time and effort but also giving them more control over their code and what is possible.\n",
    "- Lightweight : There are few constituent parts that need to be assembled and reassembled, and it doesn’t rely on a large number of extensions to function.\n",
    "- Documentation : Flask users will find a healthy number of examples and tips arranged in a structured manner."
