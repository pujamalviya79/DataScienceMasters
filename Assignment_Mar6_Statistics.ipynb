    "Types of Statistics:\n",
    "1. Descriptive Statistics : Descriptive statistics uses data that provides a description of the population either through numerical calculation or graph or table. \n",
    "        It provides a graphical summary of data. \n",
    "        It is simply used for summarizing objects, etc.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Descriptive Statistics can be of following types:\n",
    "        a. Measure of central tendency – Measure of central tendency is also known as summary statistics that is used to represents the center point or a particular value of a data set or sample set.\n",
    "            There are three common measures of central tendency as below:\n",
    "                Mean\n",
    "                Median\n",
    "                Mode\n",
    "        b. Measure of Variability –Measure of Variability is also known as measure of dispersion and used to describe variability in a sample or population.\n",
    "            There are three types of Measure of Variability as below:\n",
    "                Range\n",
    "                Variance\n",
    "                Dispersion\n",
    "                \n",
    "2. Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "        Inferential Statistics makes inference and prediction about population based on a sample of data taken from population. \n",
    "        It generalizes a large dataset and applies probabilities to draw a conclusion.\n",

    "-------\n",
    "There are two types of data: \n",
    "    1. Qualitative -- Qualitative or Categorical Data is data that can’t be measured or counted in the form of numbers. \n",
    "        These types of data are sorted by category, not by number. \n",
    "        That’s why it is also known as Categorical Data. \n",
    "        These data consist of audio, images, symbols, or text. \n",

    "            a. Nominal data - Nominal Data is used to label variables without any order or quantitative value. \n",

    "            b. Ordinal data - Ordinal data have natural ordering where a number is present in some kind of order by their position on the scale.\n",
    "                Example : \n",
    "                    When companies ask for feedback, experience, or satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10\n",

    "        This scale has certain characteristics, but doesn’t have any form of numerical meaning.\n",
    "        Example : \n",
    "            Nominal with order: Some nominal data can be sub-categorised in order, such as “cold, warm, hot and very hot.\n",
    "            Nominal without order: Nominal data can also be sub-categorised as nominal without order, such as male and female.\n",
    "2. Ordinal scale of measurement : The ordinal scale defines data that is placed in a specific order. \n",
    "        While each value is ranked, there’s no information that specifies what differentiates the categories from each other. \n",
    "        These values can’t be added to or subtracted from.\n",
    "        Example : \n",
    "            Someone finished in a race also describes ordinal data. \n",
    "            While first place, second place or third place shows what order the runners finished in,\n",
    "            it doesn’t specify how far the first-place finisher was in front of the second-place finisher.\n",
    "3. Interval scale of measurement - The interval scale contains properties of nominal and ordered data, but the difference between data points can be quantified. \n",
    "        This type of data shows both the order of the variables and the exact differences between the variables. \n",
    "        They can be added to or subtracted from each other, but not multiplied or divided. \n",
    "        Example:\n",
    "            40 degrees is not 20 degrees multiplied by two.\n",
    "4. Ratio scale of measurement - Ratio scales of measurement include properties from all four scales of measurement. \n",
    "        The data is nominal and defined by an identity, can be classified in order, contains intervals and can be broken down into exact value.\n",
    "        Data in the ratio scale can be added, subtracted, divided and multiplied.\n",

    "Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain\n",
    "how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.\n",
    "--------\n",
    "Measures of central tendency : Measures of central tendency are summary statistics that represent the center point or typical value of a dataset.\n",
    "The central tendency of the dataset can be found out using the three important measures namely mean, median and mode.\n",
    "    Mean : The mean represents the average value of the dataset. \n",
    "        It can be calculated as the sum of all the values in the dataset divided by the number of values.\n",
    "    Median : Median is the middle value of the dataset in which the dataset is arranged in the ascending order or in descending order. \n",
    "        When the dataset contains an even number of values, then the median value of the dataset can be found by taking the mean of the middle two values.\n",
    "    Mode : The mode represents the frequently occurring value in the dataset. \n",
    "        Sometimes the dataset may contain multiple modes and in some cases, it does not contain any mode at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variability: Variability refers to how spread scores are in a distribution out; that is, it refers to the amount of spread of the scores around the mean. \n",
    "    For example, distributions with the same mean can have different amounts of variability or dispersion.\n",
    "    Range : The most basic measure of variation is the range, which is the distance from the smallest to the largest value in a distribution.\n",
    "        Range= Largest value – Smallest Value\n",
    "    Interquartile range : The interquartile range (IQR) is the range of the middle 50% scores in a distribution:\n",
    "        IQR= 75th percentile  – 25th percentile\n",
    "    Variance : The variance is the average squared difference of the scores from the mean. \n",
    "        To compute the variance in a population:\n",
    "            Calculate the mean\n",
    "            Subtract the mean from each score to compute the deviation from mean score\n",
    "            Square each deviation score (multiply each score by itself)\n",
    "            Add up the squared deviation score to give the sum\n",
    "            Divide the sum by the number of scores\n",
    "    Standard deviation : The standard deviation is the average amount by which scores differ from the mean. \n",
    "        The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, and it is a useful measure of variability when the distribution is normal or approximately normal. \n",
    "        The proportion of the distribution within a given number of standard deviations (or distance) from the mean can be calculated."
