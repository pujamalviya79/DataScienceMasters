    "Encoding is a technique of converting categorical variables into numerical values so that it could be easily fitted to a machine learning model.\n",
    "Models only work with numerical values. \n",

    "So the machine can learn from those data and gives the right model. \n",
    "This process of converting categorical data into numerical data is called Encoding."
